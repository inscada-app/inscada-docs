inSCADA automatically records all significant events on the platform. Logs are stored in a time-series database and can be queried by date range.

## Event Logs

**Menu:** Logs → Log

![Event Log](../../../../../assets/docs/log-event.png)

Each event record contains the following information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **activity** | Operation name |
| **msg** | Log message |
| **logSeverity** | Level: Information, Warning, Error |
| **dttm** | Timestamp |
| **projectId** | Related project |

### Automatically Recorded Events

| Event | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Script error | Error | Script execution errors and stack trace |
| Connection change | Information | Connection start/stop |
| Configuration change | Information | Project, variable, alarm CRUD operations |
| User action | Information | Login, logout, password change |

### Writing Logs from Scripts

Log entries can be created manually from within scripts:

```javascript
ins.writeLog("INFO", "Automation", "Shift change completed");
// → OK
```

### Querying Logs

```javascript
var end = ins.now();
var start = ins.getDate(end.getTime() - 3600000); // 1 hour
var logs = ins.getLogsByPage(start, end, 0, 10);
```

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "activity": "Script Test",
    "dttm": 1774688982859,
    "msg": "Documentation test log entry",
    "projectId": 153,
    "logSeverity": "Information"
  }
]
```

### Retention Period

Event logs are retained for **14 days** by default. This duration is determined by the InfluxDB retention policy (`event_log_rp`).

---

## Login Attempts (Auth Log)

**Menu:** System → Auth Log

All login attempts (successful and failed) are recorded:

```json
{
  "msg": "inscada logged in successfully",
  "ip": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1",
  "username": "inscada",
  "date": { "epochSecond": 1774689046 },
  "isSuccessful": true
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **username** | User who attempted to log in |
| **ip** | Client IP address |
| **isSuccessful** | Whether it was successful |
| **msg** | Detail message |
| **date** | Timestamp |

### Security Monitoring

```javascript
// Check failed login attempts
var attempts = ins.getLastAuthAttempts();
var failed = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < attempts.size(); i++) {
    if (!attempts.get(i).isSuccessful) {
        failed++;
    }
}
if (failed > 5) {
    ins.notify("error", "Security",
        failed + " failed login attempts!");
}
```

### Retention Period

Login attempts are retained for **365 days** (`auth_attempt_rp`).

## Online Users

**Menu:** System → Auth Log → Online Users

Displays the currently logged-in users. Administrators can terminate active sessions.

---

## Script Logs

If a script has the `log: true` setting enabled, each execution result is automatically logged:
- Successful execution duration
- Error message and stack trace in case of failure

```json
{
  "activity": "test",
  "msg": "Script test failed. Cause: TypeError: ins.getScripts is not a function",
  "logSeverity": "Error"
}
```

---

## Console Log

Debug logs can be written using `ins.consoleLog()`:

```javascript
ins.consoleLog("Debug: power = " + power + " kW");
```

These logs appear in the server console output (stdout).
